The problem we are tackling is accurately predicting the daily number of new cases of COVID-19 from April 1st 2020 to August 28th 2021.


The BC covid cases data we worked on comes from the public domain, which includes daily numbers of new covid-19 cases and the wastewater data containing wastewater RNA counts that are collected from 5 different plants each week.
